Last night I noticed that my website's had incorrect glue records at `*.gtld-servers.net` since probably mid-2012---which explains why a number of ISPs weren't resolving it at all!

[Paul Young explains][P] what this means, and [SmallClanger remarks in this ServerFault answer][SC] that it isn't supposed to happen with modern software. The issue was probed using [Squish][Sq] and dig; and fixed by changing the nameservers listed at the registrar, forcing the glue records to be rewritten. Correctness was checked afterwards using [whatsmydns.net][W].
