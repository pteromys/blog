[git-annex][ga_home] lets git track files
and delegates the actual storage to some other backend
(plain files or a "special remote"). For your photo collection, you
probably just want the [git-annex assistant][ga_assistant].
But if not, here's a cribsheet for everyday operations...

## The cribsheet

{% include figure.html alt="Some assembly required." src="git-annex.png" imgextra="itemprop=\"image\"" %}

...and now you see why it's do-it-yourself. So...

Copy this onto some scratch paper[^stickynote] and skim through the
[git-annex walkthrough][ga_walkthrough] for the command that each arrow
represents (a forked arrow counts as one arrow).
Use the thick orange arrows for your files
and the dotted purple arrows for the tracking info.
(And that purple dot next to "remotes" represents a copy of
the long purple arrow as a fork.)

[^stickynote]: I'd suggest you do this on a sticky note on your monitor,
    but sticky notes are kind of small. Anyway, it's probably better if
    you lose it next week and have to do this exercise a second time---after
    that, you'll have it memorized for sure.

Don't be afraid to set up a test repo and remote somewhere in `/tmp`.
Later, when it's time to create a repo for a real-world use case,
here are the quick hits...

## Setup time analysis paralysis for a real repo

* `git config --global annex.genmetadata true`
    * This automatically records the creation month of each file annexed.
    * For later reading: [uses of metadata][ga_metadata] and [autogenerating more metadata][ga_autometadata].
* For each remote: any [encryption][ga_encryption]? (none, hybrid, or other?)
    * If yes, maybe you also want [chunking][ga_chunking].
* Which hash to use: [annex.backend][ga_backends] (set in `.gitattributes`).
    * The default `SHA256E` (SHA-2 of content and file extension) is probably fine.
