title: Highlights of Simon Tatham's puzzle collection

I recently discovered [Simon Tatham's remarks][1] on writing friendly (i.e. guaranteed solvable) puzzle games. Of note:

1. a variant of minesweeper that never requires you to guess
2. a pile of proofs in [net.c][2], along with tactics to generate uniquely solvable boards for a game you might know as KNetWalk.
3. [untangle.c][3], a reimplementation of [Planarity][4] with a different graph generation method (see `static char * new_game_desc`).
