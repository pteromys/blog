In August 2007, some X users wanted the function keys (F1--F12) to have [explicit modifier-key variants ("shift levels")][FeatureRequest] for internationalization purposes.

[FeatureRequest]: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11822

So after three years of silence and a little discussion, it got implemented in xkeyboard-config in June 2011. [The new levels got filled with "VoidSymbol" as a placeholder.][VoidSymbol]

Saying "VoidSymbol" when you mean "F1" might be a bad idea, as [some users noticed][VoidOops].

Fortunately there was already [an obvious fix (2011 Oct)][FixInitial],
and people [really did think it worked][LGTM].

[FixInitial]: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/commit/?id=1d1338afa
[LGTM]: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/26414

Alas, [some users still had symptoms][Symptoms].

In September 2012, [the discussion had a breakthrough][Reopened],
which led to changes [in GTK+][FixGTK] and [in xkeyboard-config][FixXkb].

[Reopened]: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45008#c23
[FixGTK]: http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=314b6abb
[FixXkb]: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/commit/?id=a4f62448

And finally, after a system update this past November, I could---for the first time in over a year---use Shift+F3 to search backwards in my browser again.

Affected versions:

* xkeyboard-config 2.4.1 until 2.7
* gtk+ until 2.24.13 / 3.5.14
