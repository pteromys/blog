In a pale imitation of the [Victor Guillemin style][vwg],
here are seven ways to calculate the volume of an n-ball,
in seven not-so-easy but somewhat spoiler-ful exercises.
What's your favorite? And can you shed any light on
negative dimensions or the generating function in the last method?

## Elementary inductions

If you weren't satisfied with being confined to dimension 3
when you learned the formula \\[ |D^3| = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\]
for the volume of the unit 3-ball,
then I suspect you eventually figured out that you could:

Method 1
: Integrate over a 2-disc and induct from dimensions 0 and 1.
  ([Walkthrough on Wikipedia][wp_2disc])

If you were particularly bored in your calculus class,
maybe you challenged yourself to use only one base case:

Method 2
: Starting from a 1-disc instead,
  finish off the resulting integral with a
  [trigonometric substitution][wb_trig]
  and a [reduction formula][wb_reduction].

## Multivariable calculus and n-spheres

There's a variant of Method 2 for the analogue of surface area,
in which you calculate
  \\[ |S^{n+1}| = \\int\_{x=-1}^1 |S^n| (1-x^2)^{\frac{1}{2}n} \\, ds \\]
where \\(ds = (1-x^2)^{-1/2} \, dx\\)
is the [element of arc length][wp_arclength]
for \\(y = \sqrt{1-x^2}\\).
This is halfway to a purely spherical-coordinates method,
which a little multivariable calculus lets you access:

Method 3
: Carefully write down, in spherical coordinates,
  the element of \\(n\\)-volume in the unit \\(n\\)-sphere
  (the boundary \\(S^n\\) of the unit \\((n+1)\\)-ball).
  Then integrate to find \\(|S^n|\\).
  ([Walkthrough on Wikipedia][wp_spherical],
  using Beta functions instead of a reduction formula).

Or if you were bored in a probability or stats class,
maybe you pulled some shenanigans with Gaussian integrals
and the radius coordinate:

Method 4
: Using spherical symmetry, write
  \\(\\left(\\int\_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\, dx\\right)^n\\)
  as a product of \\(|S^{n-1}|\\) and a 1-variable integral
  that can be written as a value of the [Gamma function][wp_gamma].
  Then compute its value for all \\(n\\)
  by using polar coordinates in the case \\(n=2\\).
  ([Walkthrough on Wikipedia][wp_gaussian])

A high-power variant of this method is to compute the Laplace transform
of \\(f(y) = |D^n| y^{n/2} = \\int\_{|x|^2 \\leq y} dx\\)
and is [detailed by Lasserre (paywalled)][lasserre].

## Without integration

Wikipedia's a great source for these walkthroughs,
and it even includes mention of unit \\(L^p\\)-balls (with sources!).
But let's go off the trail a little bit.
Our first stop goes way back---to Archimedes's
use of [Cavalieri's principle][wp_cav] to avoid
explicitly using calculus:

{% include figure.html alt="\(D^1 \times S^1\) is a cylindrical surface, the cone on which is a solid cylinder with two cones cut out." src="archimedes-cone.png" float="right10" %}

Method 5
: Calculate that
  over each point of \\(D^n\\), the 2-dimensional cross-sections of
  \\(D^{n+2}\\) and the cone on \\(D^n \times S^1\\)
  (with vertex at the origin) have the same area.
  Then note that \\(|S^1 \times X| = 2\\pi |X|\\)
  and that passing to a height-1 cone divides volume by \\(n+2\\)
  (i.e. the dimension of the ambient space).
  ([Walkthrough by Makarov, paywalled][makarov])

As with Method 2, there's an \\(S^n\\) variant that deserves mentioning.
(To recover the same recurrence as above,
use the fact that \\(D^{n+2}\\) is the cone on \\(S^{n+1}\\)
to relate their volumes.)

Method 5&frac12;
: Calculate that
  projecting to the equatorial disc \\(f: S^n \\to D^n\\)
  multiplies n-volume by a factor of \\((1-|f(x)|^2)^{-1/2}\\).
  Since the \\(S^1\\)-shaped strip of \\(S^{n+1}\\) over \\(f(x) \\in D^n\\)
  has radius \\((1-|f(x)|^2)^{1/2}\\), conclude that
  \\(|S^{n+1}| = 2\\pi|D^n|\\).

If you're willing to think only in even dimensions (i.e. \\(D^{2n}\\)),
here's a super-cute method exploiting complex numbers
that I first heard of from my advisor:

Method 6
: Let \\((D^2)^n\\) denote the product of unit discs in \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\)
  (so its volume is \\(\\pi^n\\)), and let
  \\(E = \\{ 0 < |z\_1| < \\cdots < |z\_n| < 1\\} \\subseteq (D^2)^n\\)
  be a fundamental domain under the action of permuting the coordinates.
  Check that
  \\[ \\begin{align\*}
  f: z &\\mapsto w \\in \\mathbb{C}^n \\\\ 
  w\_1 &= z\_1 \\\\ 
  w\_i &= z\_i \\sqrt{1 - \\left| \\frac{z\_{i-1}}{z\_i} \\right|^2}
  \\end{align\*} \\]
  defines a volume-preserving diffeomorphism from \\(E\\)
  to a full-measure subset of \\(D^{2n}\\).

## Generating functions

Method 5&frac12; produces the recurrence relation
\\(|S^{n+1}| = 2\\pi |D^n|\\).
Generating functions are a tool for solving recurrence relations;
it's overkill in this case, but you can do it:

Method 7
: Let \\( b(r) = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty |D^n| r^n \\).
  Show that \\(b'(r) = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty |S^n| r^n\\),
  and use the recurrence above to conclude \\(b' = 2 + 2\\pi r b\\).
  This is a [linear ODE][wp_ode]; solve it to get
  \\[b(r) = e^{\\pi r^2} \\left(1 + 2\\int\_0^r e^{-\\pi t^2}\\, dt\\right),\\]
  and expand it as a power series to recover the coefficients \\(|D^n|\\).
  ([Walkthrough by Badger, paywalled][badger])

[Cook remarks][cook] that there ought to be some way to explain
the occurrence of the Gaussian in the formula for \\(b(r)\\);
you can get part of the way there with the following variant.

Method 7&frac12;
: The Laplace transform of \\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\\) is
  \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(y) = \\int\_0^\\infty e^{-x^2} e^{-xy} \\, dx . \\]
  Expand \\(e^{-xy}\\) as a power series,
  and use the techniques of Method 4 to write the \\(y^n\\) coefficient
  of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(y)\\) in terms of \\(|S^n|\\).
  (Yes, you can swap the integral and the sum since the sum
  of integrals converges.)

The wrinkle here is that \\(|S^n|\\) ends up
in the *denominators* of the coefficients,
while a substitution in the formula for \\(b(r)\\) shows that
  \\[ b(r) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x \\mapsto e^{-\\pi x}\\}(-2\\pi r) . \\]
Alas, I don't see how to get more directly from this Laplace transform
to \\(b(r)\\); but on the bright side, equating the coefficients
in the two variants provides a roundabout way of proving
the Gamma function's [duplication formula][wp_gammadup] at integers,
  \\[ \\Gamma(n)\\Gamma\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) =
  2^{1-2n} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\, \\Gamma(2n) . \\]

## Special values, just for fun

Trivial coefficients occur with \\(|D^0| = 1\\), \\(|D^2| = \\pi\\),
and \\(|S^5| = \\pi^3\\), which makes me think the Raspberry Pi
Foundation missed a minor branding opportunity earlier this year.
Or if you're a [tauist][tauday], you also get \\(|S^1| = \\tau\\).
For something approaching a tauist spiritual experience,
<a href="#elementary-inductions" onclick="var jax = MathJax.Hub.getAllJax(document.getElementsByTagName('article')[0]); for (var i = 0; i < jax.length; i++) { jax[i].SourceElement().innerHTML = jax[i].originalText.replace('4}{3} \\pi', '2}{3}|S^1|').replace('1-2n} \\sqrt{\\pi', '-2n} \\sqrt{|S^1|').replace(/2\\pi/g, '|S^1|').replace(/\\pi\^/g, '\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|S^1|\\right)^').replace(/\\pi/g, '\\frac{1}{2}|S^1|'); } MathJax.Hub.Queue(['Reprocess', MathJax.Hub]); return true;">go back and replace all
occurrences of \\(\\pi\\) with \\(\\frac{1}{2}|S^1|\\)</a>.

Maybe you noticed that the Gamma function is still defined at
negative half-integers, which goads you into asking whether
  \\[ |S^{-2}| = \\frac{2 \\pi^{\\frac{-2+1}{2}}}{\Gamma\\left(\\frac{-2+1}{2}\\right)} = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\]
has any meaning. Despite having stumbled over negative-dimensional
spheres in a quest to convince myself that
[(-2)-categories are a thing][baezshulman],
I'm leaning toward: [probably not][so_survey]---at least,
not in any sense that looks obviously to me like a
[moral analogue of volume][so_sidenote].
But if you've got ideas, I'm listening.
